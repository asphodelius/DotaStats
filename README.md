DotaStats is an extension that adds Dota Statistic to a Steam profile using [Stratz API](https://stratz.com/api) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org). Inspired by [FaceitStats](https://github.com/boomix/Faceit-stats).
---
Extension shows:
- Matches
- Winrate
- First Match Date
- Digital Rank
- Star Rank(if below Immortal)
- Anonymous or not

Planning to add in the future:
- [ ] Smurf or not
- [ ] Add pro division
- [ ] Add pro nickname instead of the Steam one.
- [ ] Division separation (EU, NA, etc.)
